* **PDF link on confirmation page**

If you have created a form that successfully submits and redirects to a confirmation page and have also generated a PDF, in order to provide a link to the generated PDF on the confirmation page you can store the relative URL in a token. Once you store it in a token, you can use it inside an HTML message.
