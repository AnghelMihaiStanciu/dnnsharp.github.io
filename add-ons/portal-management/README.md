### What is Portal Management Add-on?

  In short, Portal Management integrates Page Actions, Module Actions, and also has some extra Portal Actions. From now on, you can manage your pages, modules, and portals with this “know-it-all” add-on. 
   Using Portal Management you can perform the following actions:

- define permissions for specific users to add, update, load/delete modules, and page actions
- load a DNN page and module into an Action Form by a specific user
- delete a module or a page
- update a DNN page and module
- create a DNN page and module
- add, update, load, or delete a DNN module based on a new registered user in complex workflows
- write conditions that will determine at submit time whether the actions related to DNN Module Actions will get executed or not
- load/update the entire content - or just a part of it - from an HTML module
- do all of the above in a responsive way.
