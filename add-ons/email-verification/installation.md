# Installation

To use the EmailVerification add-on you need to have at least one of the following base modules: Action Form, Action Grid, DNN API Endpoint, Sharp Scheduler or InfoBox.

Install the add-on from Host &gt; Extensions just as you would any other extension. The following steps will guide you through using the EmailVerification add-on.

After Installation make a new action "Setup EmailVerification Email" where you must provide the API username and api key needed for connecting to the Neverbounce Service.
