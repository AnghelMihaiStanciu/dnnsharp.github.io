# About My Tokens

My Tokens extends the standard token replacer with new tokens (both predefined and ability to create new ones) but also comes as an integration framework.

By [Core Tokens](core-tokens.html) we mean all the predefined tokens that My Tokens comes with. These includes the tokens inherited from DotNetNuke replacer (such as User, Tab or Module) but also the new ones that My Tokens delivers such as access to the Query String, POST data, Random, Server Vars and so on.

The ability to [create new tokens](custom-tokens.html) is perhaps the most powerful feature that My Tokens comes with. These can be built from various data sources such as database queries, HTTP Requests to Web Services, spidering Web Pages, files on local disk or FTP servers and so on. The content can then be processed as XML, text using regex, HTML and other formats. [Read more...](custom-tokens.html)

By [Integration Framework](../integration-notes/notes.html) we mean the ability to communicate both internally between components/modules using the My Tokens interface to replace tokens and to expose tokens for other modules to replace, but also external integration by building Web Services for outside clients (such as desktop apps or AJAX calls from other web pages) to invoke and retrieve data.
