### Menu Settings

Under the Menu Settings tab you can configure general settings about your form, such as the template or the display mode. You can edit the following parameters:

* **Width**: Specify width as a positive integer value.Width can be specified either as an absolute size in pixels or as a percentage from the total space available. Check auto to have the menu take full available width;\(For some skins the auto option is ignored and make the skin to set to a default width\)
* **Z-index**: Z-Index determines the relation with other elements on the page. Adjust this when the menu renders under other page elements or when you need other page elements to appear on top of the menu. Most of the times the value for this field should remain empty. \(A small Z-index may cause the skin to render under the DNN Menu in Admin Mode\)
