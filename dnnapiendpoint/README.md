# Getting Started

## About DNN API Endpoint

DNN API Endpoint was born to create an easy-to-use, easy-to-understand and well-tested framework for building REST APIs to help support applications that live especially outside of DNN (mobile web, native apps, syndication, other websites, etc.). It creates URLs that when invoked will execute a configurable list of actions.

## Key Features

* **DNN RESTful APIs**

DNN API Endpoint uses REST semantics, which is a way of building applications that make full use of the web and existing tools. The benefit of this is that any app which can access the web can use the generated APIs.

* **Configurable List Of Actions**

The best part is that DNN API Endpoint creates URLs that when invoked will execute a configurable list of actions. These are the about the same actions architecture that we support in many of our products.

* **Extensions Framework**

DNN API Endpoint allows you to extend it with new functionality and customize it to your own needs, just the way you like it by implementing new actions.
