# Installation

To use the [PayPal add-on](https://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/integrations/paypal){:target="_blank"} you need to have at least one of the following base modules: Action Form, Action Grid, DNN API Endpoint, Sharp Scheduler or InfoBox.

Install the add-on from *Host > Extensions* just as you would any other extension. The following steps will guide you through using the PayPal add-on.

## Go Live

After testing your setup with the Sandbox credentials it is about time you switch to live and in order to do that you will need to make sure:
* the Go Live checkbox is checked (set to true)
* you've replaced the Sandbox credentials with your PayPal Live API Credentials

The Paypal credentials for your live account can be found in your [Paypal account](https://www.paypal.com/businessprofile/mytools/apiaccess/firstparty/signature) under
>Profile > Profile and Settings > Selling tools > API access > Manage API credentials (for NVP/SOAP Integrations)
