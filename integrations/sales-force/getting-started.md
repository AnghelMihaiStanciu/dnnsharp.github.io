### Getting Started

This Add-on provides a 2 way integration between our modules and Sales Force. It can push data to Salesforce, such as leads, contacts or any other entity, and it can also query Salesforce using SOQL - which is an SQL-like query language provided by Salesforce. Once data is retrieved, it can be stored in tokens and used in other actions down the stack.

Salesforce's customer relationship management (CRM) service is broken down into several broad categories: Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Data Cloud (including Jigsaw), Collaboration Cloud (including Chatter) and Custom Cloud (including Force.com). Salesforce users can configure their CRM application at the "platform" level. In the Salesforce system, there are tabs such as "Contacts", "Reports", "Accounts", etc. Each tab contains associated information. For example, "Contacts" has standard fields like First Name, Last Name, and Email. 

In addition to the web interface, Salesforce.com offers a REST API that enables integration with other systems. Here is were you, the DNN admin come into play! Now users can add entities and run queries, not only at the "platform" level, but from DNN platform too! An administrator can add this extension in Action Form, set up a few things, and his DNN users are good to go! This is how Action From communicates with Salesforce.
