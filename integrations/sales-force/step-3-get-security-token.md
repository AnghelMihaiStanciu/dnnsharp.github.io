### Step 3 - Get a Security Token from Salesforce

To get the security token, you will have to reset the security token, which is not so intuitive to do. In the upper right corner: <Your User Name> > My Settings. Then, on the left side: My Settings > Personal > Reset security token. After resetting it, a new security token will be sent to the account's email.

With this token you can now [configure the action in Action Form](/step_4_-_setup_action_form.md).
