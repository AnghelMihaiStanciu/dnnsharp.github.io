# Make a payment with Electronic Check

**Intro**

This type of payment allows one to submit electronic check transactions through an Bluefin Card Not Present Payment Gateway account, using Bluefin's Advanced Integration Method \(AIM\).

eCheck.Net® is Bluefin’s exclusive electronic check processing solution. eCheck.Net enables Web merchants already processing credit card transactions through the Bluefin Payment Gateway to offer their customers an additional payment option.

The security of an AIM transaction is ensured through a 128-bit Secure Sockets Layer \(SSL\) connection between the merchant’s Web server and the Bluefin Payment Gateway.

There are currently six eCheck.Net transaction types supported by the Bluefin Payment Gateway.

* Automated clearing house \(ACH\) 

Is an electronic network for financial transactions in the United States. ACH transactions in batches. ACH deposit, payroll and vendor payments.

* Electronic Benefit Transfer \(EBT\)

  is an electronic system that allows state welfare departments to issue benefits via a magnetically encoded [payment card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_card), used in the United States. The average monthly EBT payout is $125 per participant.
