# What is Sharp Scheduler?

Sharp Scheduler is a time-based and application events-based task scheduler module for DNN.

It allows for an easy way to manage, schedule and execute actions such as: run SQL Queries, DNN jobs, executables, PowerShell scripts, Post Data, send emails and execute methods automatically and periodically at specific times/intervals (time triggers, interval triggers, cron triggers) or when an event occurs (on application start/end, at the beginning/end of every request).

### Key Features:

**Enterprise-Focused**

At DNN Sharp, we want pricing that is simple, straightforward, fair to the typical user and fosters adoption across your organization.  

**Extensions Framework**

Sharp Scheduler can be extended and customized as per your own needs from a minor utility that carries a simple task to a full-blown application that performs many complex actions. 

**DNN Schedule Migration**

If you have specific tasks added to the DNN schedule, donâ€™t worry; with Sharp Scheduler you are able to migrate them.
