# Conditional display of fields

## Field Condition

This is a server side expression (C# and [My Tokens](/my-tokens/index.html)) that programatically hides an entire column. As it applies to entire the column, specific tokens that relate to a particular row are not available. See [More examples](/common/conditions.html).

## Cell Condition

This is a server side expression (C# and [My Tokens](/my-tokens/index.html)) that programatically hides an entire column. As it applies to entire the column, specific tokens that relate to a particular row are not available. See [More examples](/common/conditions.html).

## Enable Conditionally

This boolean expression is used to determine if this field will be enabled (accepting input). A common example is [SomeField] == "Some Value". This field supports [My Tokens](/my-tokens/index.html).
