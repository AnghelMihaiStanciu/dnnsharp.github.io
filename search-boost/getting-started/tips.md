### Tips

1. We have an **autocomplete** function. This is enabled by default: *Autocomplete Options Count = 8*. Every search query entered 3 times will be used as a autocomplete suggestion.
2. You can set a **default search** if you want. In **Results** module settings set **Instance Name** and **Search Terms** (leave empty if you want to have all possible results displayed).
