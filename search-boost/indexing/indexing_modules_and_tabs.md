#### Indexing Modules and Tabs

Besides the introductory things shown in Getting started there are some advanced options regarding the indexing of modules and pages.

So we know that we can select what modules to be indexed in Portals -> Pages subtree. At the moment, we ignore the "Allow Indexing" properties for both tab and module. We rather use the Pages Tree for enable / disable module or page indexing.

Another place that determines what modules should be indexed is Exceptions.

One setting not so obvious exists in Search Engine -> Search Options: Merge Module Content. By default this is set to Merge by page and query string which means that modules' contents are put together. When Merge Module Content is set the indexing stats show the number of Pages, when Do not merge is set the indexing stats show the number of Modules.
