#### SearchBoost New Features



* **Ignore DNN Security**: This will add a new checkbox under the **Advanced Settings** tab. If this option is ticked, in results will be listed all pages, even if the user does not have access to that page. Instead of showing the page, he will be redirected to the login page. \(**upcoming feature**\);
