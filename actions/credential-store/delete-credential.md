# Delete Credentials

Through the Delete Credentials action a given entry can be removed. This can be done using one of our popular modules: [Action Form](//www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/action-form-builder) or  [Action Grid Module](//www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/action-grid-table-data).

**Entry ID **- the unique identifier of the entity wanted to be removed. This field supports [My Tokens](/my-tokens/index.html).
