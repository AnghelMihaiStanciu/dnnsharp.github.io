# Date \(with jQuery DatePicker\)

The datepicker is tied to a standard form input field. Focus on the input \(click, or use the tab key\) to open an interactive calendar in a small overlay. Choose a date, click elsewhere on the page \(blur the input\), or hit the Esc key to close. If a date is chosen, feedback is shown as the input's value.

Determines which date is_ initially selected_. Supports [My Tokens](http://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/my-custom-tokens) so you can pull data from various sources such as \[DateTime:Now\].
