# Text Box

###### Insert page break in text field title

If you would like to insert a page break into the front-end Title of a Text Box \(or other field\) so that you can specify where the text breaks in the Title, or have a sub-title, you should insert &lt;br&gt; before Title to create more space before it. If you would like to manage text size, in UI Settings -&gt; Label CSS Styles add this syntax : text-transform: lowercase or text-transform: uppercase.
