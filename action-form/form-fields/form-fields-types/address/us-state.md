# US States

Allows users to select a US state from the dropdown. On submit, this field generates the following tokens: \[&lt;FieldName&gt;\] \(which yields the state code, or if that doesn't exist, it will fall back to state name\), \[&lt;FieldName&gt;:StateCode\], \[&lt;FieldName&gt;:StateName\].
