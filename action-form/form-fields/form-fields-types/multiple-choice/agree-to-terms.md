# Agree to Terms

It’s pretty clear that including a Privacy Policy or a Terms and Conditions section on your website is important.

This field allows a user to agree to your terms or legal agreements by requiring the user to take some form of action, typically clicking the “Agree to Terms and Conditions” checkbox. A link is provided to your Terms of Service agreement page and the user must click a button marked “Terms and Conditions” to read them.

## Options

  * If this field is used, this will be the Internal Page Terms and Conditions URL.

* Custom Url

  * Or, freely provide an URL, for example: [http://OtherWebsite.com/TermsAndConditions.html](http://OtherWebsite.com/TermsAndConditions.html). Can contain [My Tokens](http://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/my-custom-tokens).
