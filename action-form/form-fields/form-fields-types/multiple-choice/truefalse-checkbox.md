# True/False \(Checkbox\)

This field creates a single input checkbox. It should always be used for a field that has a boolean value: if the box is checked, the field will be set to true, if the box is unchecked, the value will be set to false.

# Options

* Initially Checked
  * Determines whether this field will load initially checked. Possible values are _True/False_. Supports [My Tokens](/my-tokens/index.html) so you can pull data from various sources such as user profile.
