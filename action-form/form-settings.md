# Form Settings

The **Action Form** settings, highlighted on the image below, allows you to configure the layout and appearance of the form. These settings are managed in the General Settings section. Our **Action Form** module is highly configurable so it can be set on every website with different designs. More info on how to change the look & feel of forms, you will find under <a href="/action-form/Apperance.html">Appearance</a> and <a href="/action-form/form-layout.html">Form Layout</a> sections.
