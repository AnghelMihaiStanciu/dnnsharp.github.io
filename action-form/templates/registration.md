# Registration Form

Action Form comes with a Registration Form template already created for you. This offers a smoother user experience for those looking to sign up for a website - if a user doesn't have an account but would like to create one, this will bring him to the registration page. Some surveys suggest that websites with shorter registration forms have larger lists of new users on a daily basis. This is an explanation for why we have created a smaller registration form for you to use. The Registration form template creates a basic form which collects the Name, Email, User and Password, creates a new user account and sends a standard registration email to users. Like all the other forms, the registration form is also customizable, so you can add, remove, add CSS styles, reorder the fields.
