### Clear State

This action has the purpose of clearing the previously saved state, for example, if you have a contact form and on its button you've set the Save state on server session action, to not keep the values that the user fills in the boxes, you can use the Clear state action so that the form refreshes and clears all the data which was inserted in the boxes.
