### Save State

This action saves all the submitted data in the server session so it can be loaded back into this or another form. You need to use a key, in the key field, under which the data will be saved, and you also need to specify where the saved data will be stored in the Save Location, either by selecting the Server Session or the Browser Cookies. Keep in mind that the server data is lost after a period of inactivity, usually after 20 minutes, browser cookies usually last longer.
