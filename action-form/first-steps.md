# Getting Started

### How to Use Action Form

Basically, you can have an Action Form module fully functional simply by going to the Manage Form main page, choosing a predefined template form \(Contact, Log in, Registration, Subscribe to MailChimp\), and clicking the Back button. This adds on the page a form with default settings, or you can start with a new form from scratch by selecting the Blank form template so that you can configure it according to your needs.

With each upgrade we include new cool features. We have also complied a list with tutorials in order to help you better manage the module; click [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLttZcObtJJgEKrfRwwe4FqXcRysIKhyMX) to see them.

### How to Install Action Form

You can download the latest version from Action Form Download Page. While you are on that page, you can also check the changelog to see what's new.

In order to install Action Form module on your DNN website, you can follow the steps below:

1. Begin by logging into your DNN site with host account;

2. From the Host Menu option select Extensions;

3. In the Extensions module menu, click on Install Extension Wizard button;

4. On the Upload New Extension Package page, click on Choose File button;

5. Select the Action Form package you previously downloaded on your hard drive, then click on Open;

6. Click on Next, accept the license, continue through the install. If all goes well, you will get a list of messages with "EndJob Installation Successful" at the bottom. When all is finished, click on Return button.

And that's pretty much all about the installation; the next step is to activate the module from production or if you try a demo, you have to unlock the trial for 30 days - these two options are displayed as a warning message at the bottom of the module after it has been added on a page.

### Add Action Form Module to your page

In the steps below, we will show you how to add a predefined contact form - don't forget that Action Form is configurable, so you have the ability to create many other more complex forms.

When the page you work on is opened, select the Modules option from the top menu and click on the Add New Module option.

### Action Form General Settings

The Action Form settings, highlighted in the image below, allow you to configure the layout and appearance of the form. These settings are accessible in the Form by going to the manage page and enlarging the General Settings list. Our Action Form module is highly configurable so it can be set on every website with different designs.

### Action Form Fields

In this section, you can change the settings for your form fields. It allows you to customize the form fields and adjust various options such as UI settings, validations, etc. You can add, remove, and reorder fields according to your needs. After you finish setting up the fields, click on Save button. More details about how fields can be configured can be found under the Form Fields section.

Also, if you click on the Layout Mode button, a panel will be displayed from where you can configure the fields' layout - you can change their order, size, or even place them in columns. More details about this option can be found in the Form Layout section.

### Action Form Events

The next step to configure Action Form is to set up the Events. It determines what happens when the form is successfully submitted by the user. Each Event has different actions, each offering specific functions such as email notifications, user registration, SQL queries, and so on. More details about these options can be found under the Form Events section.
