# Containers

Easy Container behave pretty much as standard DotNetNuke containers except they provide a link to open a popup dialog where Easy Container does its magic. 

In this section read about:

* [The format of Easy Containers](/easy-container/containers/format.html).
  What files a container consist and what does each one do

* [Container Management](/easy-container/containers/management.html)
  Learn how to create, clone, reuse and delete containers

* [Special Containers](/easy-container/containers/special-containers.html)
  Easy Container uses some special containers to implement smooth workflow

We make a **note** here regarding the upgrade from one version to another, when you have existing containers created with container options (we talk about the "Module Container" options from "Page Settings"), on an upgrade to a new Easy Grid version. the predefined containers will be overwritten. There is though a "create new container" option, and any container created from scratch will be saved and kept on upgrade. You'll even get a warning message on the "What's new" step informing you about the upgrade differences when you'll install the new version of Easy Container.
